# Kosaraju-SCC
Find Stable Connected Components using Kosarajus Algorithm 

# Description
  Finding Strongly Connected Components or SCC in a Graph using Adjacency Lists. Once the components are found a Kernal Graph is generated using these components. 
  The Output lists the SCC as well as the Kernel Graph.
  
  Time Complexity: O ( V + E )

  Sample Input via terminal : 
  
   Number of Vertices\
   Number of Edges\
   Edge 1 \
   Edge 2\
   Edge n

### Compiling and Running
